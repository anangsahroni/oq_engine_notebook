There is still a problem regarding the dependency, you can install it manually.

how to use (will be revised using requirements.txt after dependency resolve):

1. pip install openquake.engine
2. pip install --user https://github.com/matplotlib/basemap/archive/master.zip
3. pip install notebook
4. pip install pandas
